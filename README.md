# BitBubble ðŸ«§

This was written over some earl gray tea and studying the [Intel 8086/8088 instruction manual](https://edge.edx.org/c4x/BITSPilani/EEE231/asset/8086_family_Users_Manual_1_.pdf) and doing a course called "Performance Aware Programming". If you enjoy this code, go ahead. But in general this is just meant as a public notebook for me to keep track of what's going on in the course. Plus, the code is note that nice.

## Tasks

The first task:
- Write a program that can take in a bit stream and decode the `mov` instruction
- Only required to implement register to register mov/copy
- run `just compile-mov-example` which converts the `mov_example.asm` to binary
- `cargo run` takes that binary and decodes it back to assembly
